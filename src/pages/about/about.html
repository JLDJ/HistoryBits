History Bits goal is to encourage users to submit bits of history and have others collaborate and add more information on that bit of history. The History Bits repository is composed of pictures, videos, recipes, stories, songs, and any other bits of history submitted by users. This repository is then searchable by other users which they can then follow bits of history that are interesting to them.
